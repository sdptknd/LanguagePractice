Here's an exhaustive list of common dotnet commands with their functions:

1. Project Management

dotnet new <template> :
Creates a new project based on a template (e.g., console, web, classlib).
Example: dotnet new console creates a new console application.

dotnet restore:
Restores all NuGet packages and dependencies specified in the project file (*.csproj or *.vbproj).
Ensures all necessary libraries are available for the project.

dotnet clean:
Removes all intermediate and output files generated by previous builds (e.g., bin, obj folders).
Helps to ensure a clean build environment.

dotnet sln:
Manages solution files (.sln).
Commands include add, remove, list, etc., to add/remove projects from a solution.

2. Build & Run

dotnet build:
Builds the project and generates output files (DLLs, EXEs, etc.).
Can be customized with options like -c <Configuration> (e.g., Debug, Release) and -f <Framework> (e.g., net6.0).

dotnet run:
Builds and runs the application.
Convenient for quick testing and development iterations.

dotnet publish:
Publishes the application for deployment.
Creates output files suitable for different deployment targets (e.g., self-contained executables).

3. Testing

dotnet test:
Runs unit tests and integration tests within the project.
Utilizes testing frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.

4. Packaging

dotnet pack:
Creates a NuGet package (.nupkg) from the project.
Enables sharing reusable components with others.

5. Other Useful Commands

dotnet add package <PackageName>:
Adds a NuGet package reference to the project.

dotnet remove package <PackageName>:
Removes a NuGet package reference from the project.

dotnet user-secrets:
Manages user secrets (sensitive configuration values) for the project.

dotnet --version:
Displays the installed .NET SDK version.

dotnet help:
Displays help information for any dotnet command.


## Internal Working

.NET SDK: The core of the dotnet CLI. Provides the tools and libraries for building, running, and testing .NET applications.
Project File: (*.csproj or *.vbproj) Contains project metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.
MSBuild: The build engine that processes the project file and drives the build process.
NuGet: Package manager for retrieving and installing dependencies.


## Inter-dependencies

dotnet restore is often a prerequisite for dotnet build, dotnet run, and dotnet publish.
dotnet build is typically required before dotnet run and dotnet publish.
The success of dotnet test depends on the proper setup of the testing framework and test projects.


## Key Considerations

Command Options: Most commands accept various options to customize behavior (e.g., -c, -f, -o, -v).
Cross-Platform Compatibility: dotnet is designed to work across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
