1. This is a new initiated console project created using `dotnet new console`

2. You can run `dotnet new` or `dotnet new list` to choose from different project templates to create from 

3. A dotnet solution usually have a `.sln` file outside and multiple project directories at root. Each project directory will have `.csproj` file where we can configure the project, it's dependencies etc. For my case I've a single small project, that's why no separate project directory, rather root only has `.csproj` file.
